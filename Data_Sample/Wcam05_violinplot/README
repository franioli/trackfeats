Source data for creating a violin plot for velocity distribution of the stable and moving areas (Figure 5 c)
Use 05_Violin_plot.py

This data is the output of following two codes: 
03_Velocity_calcul_txt.py - Calculates distance and velocities between 2 txt files as output of the image-2-geometry algorithm
04_aggregate_spatially_txt - Seperateds the points between stable and moving area based on user specific polygon
