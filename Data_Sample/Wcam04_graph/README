Source data for Figure 6 - weekly velocity graph

Achieved by running: 
03_Velocity_calcul_txt.py - Calculates distance and velocities between 2 txt files as output of the image-2-geometry algorithm
04_aggregate_spatially_txt - Seperateds the points between stable and moving area based on user specific polygon
06_Velocity_cumdistance_cam4.py - Creates the graph used in Figure 6 of the paper
